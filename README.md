# ❤️‍🔥 Heart Disease Prediction with Imbalanced Data Handling

## 🧠 Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using clinical and lifestyle data, while addressing the class imbalance problem using techniques like SMOTE and under-sampling. The goal is to build an intelligent system that can assist in early diagnosis.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration using Python and Pandas.
- Handling data imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling).
- Training and evaluating machine learning models.
- Creating a simple Flask API for real-time predictions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- Flask
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
